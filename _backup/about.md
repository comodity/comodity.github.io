# Mission 

The workshop on Conceptual Modeling for Digital Twins (CoMoDiTy) aims at 
bringing together researchers and practitioners working on modeling concepts, 
methods, and tools for bringing the vision of digital twins to life. As such, 
it aspires to be a truly interdisciplinary meeting for researchers from 
conceptual modeling, model-driven software and systems engineering, and 
production engineering.
