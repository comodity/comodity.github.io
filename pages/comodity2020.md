# Mission 

The workshop on Conceptual Modeling for Digital Twins (CoMoDiTy) aims at 
bringing together researchers and practitioners working on modeling concepts, 
methods, and tools for bringing the vision of digital twins to life. As such, 
it aspires to be a truly interdisciplinary meeting for researchers from 
conceptual modeling, model-driven software and systems engineering, and 
production engineering.

# Topics of Interest

The topics of interested of CoMoDiTy 2020 include but are not limited to the following:

- Conceptual modeling techniques for digital shadows and digital twins
- Theories for conceptual modeling of digital twins in the context of the observed cyber-physical systems
- Modeling methods and tools for developing digital shadows and digital twins
- Evolution
- Interaction of digital twin models and design time and at runtime
- Systematic derivation of digital twins
- Learning digital twins from observing system behavior
- Operating digital twins with humans in the loop
- Code generation and interpretation of executable digital twins
- Modeling distributed and scalable data for digital twins
